# loshell
A CLI utility that allows to use some of the iterators from the samber/lo library on files.

# NOTE

I'll be suspending work on this project until further notice.
At first the idea seemed interesting to me, but then I concluded that there is little innovation to this program. 
If you want to have a Go repl that has more features than Go playground, try yaegi. 

And if you fancy a functional programming language with a REPL, Clojure, Common LISP, Elixir or even just JS and Python are already there and their repls are way more feature-rich than this project would ever offer.
